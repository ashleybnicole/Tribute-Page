    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Zhang Yin's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1957</strong> - Zhang Yin was born and grew up in Guangdong, China. Although a former junior officer in the Red Army, her father was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, in 1966, so Zhang was unable to gain further education.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1980's</strong> - She worked locally, as an accountant, before moving to Hong Kong in the early 1980s, to work in a paper trading company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1985</strong> - The Chinese Government liberalised economic restrictions and Zhang took the opportunity to start a paper trading business in Hong Kong, with 30,000 Yuan of her own money (less than US$4,000). As her ambitions outgrew the opportunities in Hong Kong, she moved to the United States.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1990</strong> - She re-married and, with her new husband, created America Chung Nam in 1990. Based in Los Angeles, it gathered high quality waste paper (made in the US from wood pulp) and exported it by container vessel to China, where paper pulp is of lower quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1995</strong> - She expanded again, after returning to Hong Kong. With her husband and brother, Zhang created Nine Dragons Paper (NDP), which quickly became Asia’s largest manufacturer of packaging paper – mainly ‘container board’ – the corrugated cardboard used to package most of the world’s products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2002</strong> - Zhang Yin and her husband were driving around the United States in a used Dodge Caravan minivan, begging garbage dumps to give them their scrap paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quote</strong> - "I remember what a man in the business told me back then," Zhang Yin said. "He said, 'Waste paper is like a forest. Paper recycles itself, generation after generation.'"
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <strong>2006</strong> - The Hurun Report cited Zhang as the richest person in China with a wealth of US$3.6 billion. Without a doubt she is the richest self-made woman in the world, exceeding JK Rowling and Oprah Winfrey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2007</strong> - The business suffered a series of setbacks from 2007, but Zhang’s sense of privacy means there is little publicly available information to document this. But at time of writing, she remains a dollar billionaire and both ACN and NDP continue to trade successfully.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2010</strong> - Zhang's personal fortune was valued at approximately US$4.6 billion, making her the wealthiest self-made woman in the world, ahead of Oprah Winfrey, J.K. Rowling, Giuliana Benetton, Meg Whitman, and Rosalia Mera. Forbes magazine put her wealth at US$1.35 billion in November 2006, which would have made her then the richest woman in China and the fifth richest person in China. (On a later Forbes list she was displaced as China's richest woman by 25-year-old Yang Huiyan)
      </li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Zhang was named Asian CEO of the Year for 2014 at RISI's 15th annual Asian Pulp and Paper Conference.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> - Forbes estimates her wealth to be US$1.12 B, the #384 richest person in China (down from #216 in 2014), and the #1724 richest person in the world

      <h3>
        What Can We Learn from Zhang Yin?
      </h3>
      <cite>Zhang spotted a big gap in a huge market!
        
        ‘‘Where there’s muck, there’s brass’’

This is a saying from the north of England. Zhang spotted a shortage of good quality waste paper to supply the Chinese paper making industry and filled that gap. At that point, she realised that the fragmented and small scale manufacturing industry in China offered a gap she could fill with one large consolidated paper packaging manufacturer. Now she had control of the raw materials and the manufacturing capacity.</cite>
